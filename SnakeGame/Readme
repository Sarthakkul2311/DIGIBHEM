# Snake Game

Snake Game is a classic game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It provides a simple and enjoyable gaming experience where the player controls a snake, trying to eat targets to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game screen.

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats a target.
- Game Over screen: When the game ends, a Game Over screen is displayed, showing the final score and providing options to quit or play again.
